Smart Agriculture is the Project which was a prototype for the agricultural feild.

Sensors which were used are:
~DHT11 => as a temperature monitioring device
~Soil Moisture sensor
~12V Motors as an actuators for supplying water to the field
~Servo's to open and close the shade
~ThingSpeak Api's for the data monitoring
This project is scalable and will help you in many aspects as if the rain happens and the moisture is already enough for the soil so the shades would automatically cover the field
